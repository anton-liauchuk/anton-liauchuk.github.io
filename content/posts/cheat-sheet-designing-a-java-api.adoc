= Cheat Sheet: Designing a Java API

This article is a quick-reference cheat sheet based on a great Devoxx presentation by Mario Fusco – _“Let’s Make a Contract: The Art of Designing a Java API.”_

Watch the talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-v1OfZOeFY[here], and check out the slides at https://speakerdeck.com/mariofusco/lets-make-a-contract-the-art-of-designing-a-java-api[here].

The goal of this article is not to explain the concepts in depth but to provide a compact reminder of the key principles to revisit when designing a Java API.

== Key Principles

* *Method signature* — Prefer using objects over primitives, especially when argument ordering is important and unclear with primitives.
* *Static factory methods* — Use static factory methods to create objects. These can return interfaces with hidden implementations.
* *Fluent API* — Consider fluent APIs as alternatives to complex constructors for better readability.
* *Weakest possible types* — Accept the weakest possible type to allow flexibility in usage.
* *Avoid checked exceptions* — They leak implementation details and increase coupling. Favor unchecked exceptions or functional handling.
* *Prefer small interfaces* — Split large interfaces into smaller, more focused ones.
* *No booleans in method signatures* — Avoid methods like `save(true)`, which are unclear. Use enums or split into separate methods.
* *Return empty collections / booleans* — Never return `null` — return empty collections or `Optional`/boolean instead.
* *Use meaningful return types* — Avoid returning raw data types when domain-specific types convey more meaning.
* *Defend API contracts* — Return unmodifiable collections to prevent external mutation.
